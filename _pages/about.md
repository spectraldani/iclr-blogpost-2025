# ICLR 2025 Blogposts Track

The Machine Learning community is currently experiencing a [reproducibility crisis](https://neuripsconf.medium.com/designing-the-reproducibility-program-for-neurips-2020-7fcccaa5c6ad) and a reviewing crisis [[Littman, 2021]](#Litt). Because of the highly competitive and noisy reviewing process of ML conferences [[Tran et al., 2020]](#Tran), researchers have an incentive to oversell their results, slowing down the progress and diminishing the integrity of the scientific community. Moreover with the growing number of papers published and submitted at the main ML conferences [[Lin et al., 2020]](#Lin), it has become more challenging to keep track of the latest advances in the field.

Blog posts are becoming an increasingly popular and useful way to talk about science [[Brown and Woolston, 2018]](#Brow). They offer substantial value to the scientific community by providing a flexible platform to foster open, human, and transparent discussions about new insights or limitations of a scientific publication. However, because they are not as recognized as standard scientific publications, only a minority of researchers manage to maintain an active blog and get visibility for their efforts. Many are well-established researchers ([Francis Bach](https://francisbach.com/), [Ben Recht](https://www.argmin.net/), [Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/), [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/)) or big corporations that leverage entire teams of graphic designers designer and writers to polish their blogs ([Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/?page=1), [Google AI](https://ai.googleblog.com/), [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/blog), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/)). As a result, the incentives for writing scientific blog posts are largely personal; it is unreasonable to expect a significant portion of the machine learning community to contribute to such an initiative when everyone is trying to establish themselves through publications.

**Submit** your blogpost on [Openreview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2025/BlogPosts).

## A Call for Blog Posts

Last year, we ran the **third** iteration of the [Blogpost track](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2024/about) at ICLR 2024! 
It was very successful, with accepted posts presented in person at the main conference.
<!-- Our goal is to create a formal call for blog posts at ICLR to incentivize and reward researchers to: -->
We invite all researchers and practitioners to submit a blog post which:

1. Reviews past work and summarize the outcomes, develop new intuitions, or highlight some shortcomings. 
2. Presents novel perspectives or interpretations of existing machine learning concepts or techniques.
3. Discusses important issues in machine learning, such as reproducibility, from a novel perspective.
4. Analyzes the societal implications of recent advancements in machine learning and AI.
5. Showcases cool research ideas that you tried but did not work out.

**We will not consider politically motivated blogposts for publication.**

If you are unsure about the content of your post you can reach us at [iclr-blogpost-track@googlegroups.com](mailto:iclr-blogpost-track@googlegroups.com).

Past blog posts can be accessed here: [2022](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/home/#accepted-posts), [2023](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2023/about#accepted-posts), [2024](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2024/about#spotlight).


<!-- A very influential initiative of this kind happened after the Second World War in France. Because of the lack of up-to-date textbooks, a collective of mathematicians under the pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki [[Halmos 1957]](#Halm), decided to start a series of textbooks about the foundations of mathematics [[Bourbaki, 1939]](#Bour). 
In the same vein, we aim to provide a new way to summarize scientific knowledge in the ML community.  -->

#### Conflict of interest 

The authors of the blog posts will have to declare their conflicts of interest (positive or negative) with the paper (and the paper's authors) they write about. Conflicts of interest include:
-   Recent collaborators (less than 3 years)
-   Current institution -- reviewers will be asked to judge if the submission is sufficiently critical and objective of the papers addressed in the blog post.  
-  **Blog Posts must not be used to highlight or advertise past publications of the *authors or their lab***.

We will only ask the authors to report if they have a conflict of interest. If so, reviewers will be asked to judge if the submission is sufficiently critical and objective of the papers addressed in the blog post. 



## Publication 

The posts will be created and published under a unified template; see [the submission instructions]({{ '/submitting' | relative_url }}) and the [sample post]({% post_url 2025-04-28-distill-example %}) hosted on the blog of this website.

#### Poster

Additionally, accepted posts will have the option to present their work as a poster during the main poster session. For more information about the main poster session (time, poster format, etc.) please refer to the ICLR homepage.

## Submissions

Our goal is to avoid heavily engineered, professionally-made blog posts ---Such as the “100+ hours” mentioned as a standard by the [Distill guidelines](https://distill.pub/journal/)---to entice ideas and clear writing rather than dynamic visualizations or embedded javascript engines.
Please check our [submission instructions]({{ '/submitting' | relative_url }}) for more details.
We accept submissions in both Markdown and HTML. We believe this is a good trade-off between complexity and flexibility. 

**Submit** your blogpost on [Openreview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2025/BlogPosts&referrer=%5BHomepage%5D(%2F))

## Contact

For any technical issues with the blog post repository (for example, blog posts not displaying correctly or issues while following the [submission instructions](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2025/submitting/#creating-a-blog-post)), please open an [issue in our github repository](https://github.com/iclr-blogposts/2025/issues).
